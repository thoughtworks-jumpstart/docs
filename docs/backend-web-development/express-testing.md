# Express.js testing

## Benefits of Tests

- Tests are a faster way to verify that your APIs are working correctly, as compared to Postman.
- Tests can act as a safety net when you are required to make changes to your API later.
- Most importantly, tests help to document a **contract** between your API and the clients accessing it

## What to test

What are our tests for our Express.js code going to test for?

We should write tests to ensure that our API are:

- returning the correct HTTP status code
- returning the correct response in the body
- for all of the routes defined

## About Integration Test

The type of tests we are going to write is called integration test.

Integration tests, as the name suggests, tests that the different layers of your application (e.g. app, router, request handlers, any middleware, models and database) works as expected when integrated together.

In contrast, there is another type of tests, called Unit Test, which focus on testing a module/class/function works alone. For example, react testing library is often used to unit test a single React component.

## Tests for API

To verify that your API works as expected, usually you need to send some requests to a running instance of your application, and check the responses. This can be done manually using tools like Postman or Insomnia, but we prefer to automate those tests.

To automate those tests, the tests need to act as API consumers, issuing requests and verifying responses.

## Using Jest as a testing framework for testing our API

### Filename Conventions for Jest

Jest will look for test files at:

- Files with `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts` and `.tsx` suffix in \_\_tests\_\_ folders.
- Files with `.test.js` suffix.
- Files with `.spec.js` suffix.
  The `.test.js` / `.spec.js` files (or the \_\_tests\_\_ folders) can be located at any depth under the src top level folder.

It is recommended to put the test files next to the code they are testing so that relative imports in the test appear shorter. Alternatively, you could put tests into the \_\_tests\_\_ folder.

Read more about this in the [Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration#testregex-string--arraystring).

### Asynchronous tests with Jest

We will like to send requests to test our API. Requests are asynchronous, therefore we need to have asynchronous tests.

How can we do this with Jest?

- Add the `async` keyword
- Call `done` when you’re done with your tests if you want to tell Jest exactly where to end the test (optional)

`done` is a callback passed by Jest. Jest will wait until the done callback is called before finishing the test. Read more about it in the [Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/asynchronous#callbacks).

```js
it("Async test should do nothing", async () => {
  // Do async operations here
});
```

using the done callback is optional

```js
it("Async test should do nothing", async (done) => {
  // Do async operations here
  done();
});
```

## SuperTest

Previously, we mentioned that we will like to send requests to test our API. You can use libraries like [SuperTest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest).

SuperTest wraps around SuperAgent, which is another API for creating HTTP requests / making calls to other APIs.

### Installation

Install SuperTest and save it to your package.json file as a development dependency:

```sh
npm install supertest --save-dev
```

## Testing with Jest and SuperTest

SuperTest works without any framework but in our case we will use it along with Jest, since we are already using Jest as our testing framework.

### Refactoring for tests

Before we can start testing with SuperTest, we need to refactor our code to allow our server to be started by SuperTest for each of the tests.

Currently, our app looks like this in many of the examples where the routes exist in the same file as the server.

```js
// app.js
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Welcome to my homepage");
});

... //other code

const server = app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

This doesn’t work when creating tests because it starts listening to one port. Once you create many test files, you might come across an error that says "port in use".

To solve this problem, you need to `export` the app without listening to it. Replace the `app.listen` code with `module.exports = app;`.

```js
// app.js
module.exports = app;
```

Now how do we run the server for development or production purposes? (not testing)

Normally when we are exporting the app like above, we do this in a file called **app.js**.

We create a new file called **index.js** to start the server and make the server listen to port 3000.

We `require` the previous file to import the app.

```js
// index.js
const app = require("./app");
const PORT = 3000;

app.listen(PORT, () =>
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${PORT}`)
);
```

Run `node index.js` again to start your server. Ensure that it still works.

### Writing tests with SuperTest

First we will have to import SuperTest and our app.

```js
// app.test.js
const request = require("supertest");
const app = require("./app");
```

Test that Jest works

```js
describe("App", () => {
  it("Testing to see if Jest works", () => {
    expect(1).toBe(1);
  });
});
```

Let's add our first test for the GET "/" route! We shall write it in a Promises way...

```js
describe("App", () => {
  it("GET / should respond with Welcome to my homepage", () => {
    return request(app)
      .get("/")
      .then((response) => {
        expect(response.status).toEqual(200);
        expect(response.text).toEqual("Welcome to my homepage");
      });
  });
});
```

Oh no. Let's use async/await instead.

```js
describe("App", () => {
  it("GET / should respond with Welcome to my homepage", async () => {
    const response = await request(app).get("/").expect(200);
    expect(response.text).toEqual("Welcome to my homepage");
  });
});
```

Looks nicer! It passes with green.

What if we destructure the response to extract `text`?

```js
it("should respond correctly", async () => {
  const { text } = await request(app).get("/").expect(200);
  expect(text).toEqual("Welcome to my homepage");
});
```

`request(app)` passes the app to SuperTest. We are then able to send GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE requests.

How should we test this POST "/" route? We will need to POST some JSON and non-JSON content to the server, and then check its response.

```js
const requireJsonContent = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.headers["content-type"] !== "application/json") {
    res.status(400).send("Server wants application/json!");
  } else {
    next();
  }
};

app.post("/", requireJsonContent, (req, res, next) => {
  res.send("Thanks for the JSON!");
});
```

Using SuperTest, we can easily send strings or JSON to the server:

```js
describe("POST /", () => {
  it("should respond correctly when sending json", async () => {
    const { text } = await request(app)
      .post("/")
      .send({ thisIsJson: "json!" })
      .expect(200);
    expect(text).toEqual("Thanks for the JSON!");
  });

  it("should respond with status 400 and correct string when sending non-json", async () => {
    const { text } = await request(app)
      .post("/")
      .send("This is not json!")
      .expect(400);
    expect(text).toEqual("Server wants application/json!");
  });
});
```

### Writing test for routes

Let's see an example of writing an actual test for a route.

We want to make a test for the following endpoint:

POST /songs route of the songs API

Test: POST /songs should return a new song object
Route: POST /songs
Expected response status code: 201
Example request body:

```json
{ "name": "test movie", "artist": "rhianna" }
```

Example JSON response:

```json
{ "id": 1, "name": "test movie", "artist": "rhianna" }
```

```js
it("POST /songs should add a song and return a new song object", async () => {
  const newSong = { name: "test movie", artist: "rhianna" };
  const expectedSong = { id: 1, name: "test movie", artist: "rhianna" };

  const { response } = await request(app)
    .post("/songs")
    .send(newSong)
    .expect(201);

  expect(response.status).toEqual(201);
  expect(response.body).toEqual(expectedSong);
});
```

Could also be written as:

```js
it("POST /songs should add a song and return a new song object", async () => {
  const newSong = { name: "test movie", artist: "rhianna" };
  const expectedSong = { id: 1, name: "test movie", artist: "rhianna" };

  const { body: actualSong } = await request(app)
    .post("/songs")
    .send(newSong)
    .expect(201);

  expect(actualSong).toEqual(expectedSong);
});
```

### toMatchObject

Sometimes, we do not want to test for an exact match for the response object. We are satisfied with having certain object properties. We can make use of a useful Jest method called `toMatchObject`.

One possible use of this is for the GET /songs/:id route.

```js
  it("GET /songs/:id should return the correct song", () => {
    const expectedSong = {name: "test song", artist: "rhianna"};

    const {body: actualSong} = await request(app)
    .get("/songs/1")
    .expect(200)

    expect(actualSong).toMatchObject(expectedSong);
  });
```

### Accessing agent in SuperTest

```js
const request = require("supertest");
var app = require("./app");

const agent = request.agent(app);
```

After accessing the agent, you can use the agent directly.

For example,

```js
const agent = request.agent(app);

it("should respond correctly", async () => {
  const { text } = await agent.get("/").expect(200);
  expect(text).toEqual("Welcome to my homepage");
});
```

When should we use the agent directly?

There are some cases where we need to reuse the agent again. For example, we might need to persist cookies that were saved.

Check the [github page for supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) for an example on how to access the agent in SuperTest and reuse the agent to persist a request and its cookies.

## Exercises

Add tests to the existing songs API we have been building.

## TDD with Express.js

Besides songs and the music industry, now our company would like to go into the movie industry. We need more routes on our API. They will now return movie information.

Let's try TDD for movie routes.

Add the tests for the movies endpoints.

Test: POST /movies should return a new movie object
Route: POST /movies
Expected response status code: 201
Example request body:

```json
{
  "movieName": "Lion King"
}
```

Example JSON response:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "movieName": "Lion King"
}
```

Test: GET /songs should return an array containing one song
Route: GET /movies
Expected response status code: 200
Example JSON response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "movieName": "Lion King"
  }
]
```

Test: GET /movies/:id should return the movie with id
Route: GET /movies/1
Expected response status code: 200
Example JSON response:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "movieName": "Lion King"
}
```

Test: PUT /movies/:id should return the updated movie
Route: PUT /movies/1
Expected response status code: 200

Example request body:

```json
{
  "movieName": "Frozen 2"
}
```

Example JSON response:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "movieName": "Frozen 2"
}
```

Test: DELETE /movies/:id should return the deleted movie
Route: DELETE /movies/1
Expected response status code: 200

Example request body:

```json
{
  "movieName": "Frozen 2"
}
```

Example JSON response:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "movieName": "Frozen 2"
}
```

Test: GET /movies should return an empty array
Route: GET /movies
Expected response status code: 200

Example JSON response:

```json
[]
```
